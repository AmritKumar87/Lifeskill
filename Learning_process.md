*  Review your explanation and identify the areas where you didn’t know something or where you feel your explanation is shaky. Once you’ve pinpointed them, go back to the source material, your notes, or any examples you can find to shore up your understanding.

*  Grab a sheet of paper and write the name of the concept at the top. You can use pretty much any concept or idea – even though the technique is named after Feynman, it’s not limited solely to math and science.
*  Explain the concept in your own words as if you were teaching it to someone else. Focus on using plain, simple language. Don’t limit your explanation to a simple definition or a broad overview; challenge yourself to work through an example or two as well to ensure you can put the concept into action.

* This is a strong, proven learning technique. You can test yourself by trying to remember what you were learning or explaining it aloud to yourself or to someone prepared to listen. You can get friends to quiz you. One of the benefits is that you can get immediate feedback on whether you are right or wrong.

* Don't worry about short breaks or distractions while you're studying<br>
Learning scientists know that a short break, while you are trying to solve a problem you're stuck on, is one of the best ways to succeed. When you take a break, your brain will continue to work on the problem subconsciously, without the imposition of preconceived ideas you may have had.

* Create learning sessions where you mix knowledge areas or skills<br>
When you focus on learning one thing at a time, it is the fastest way to acquire the learning but it can put a limit on the extent of the learning.
